The design, core algorithms and structure of the software are introduced, alongside results from the analysis of data from biological and chemical crystallography experiments.},

abstract = {Combining X-ray diffraction data from multiple samples requires determination of the symmetry and resolution of any indexing ambiguity. For the partial data sets typical of {\it in situ} room-temperature experiments, determination of the correct symmetry is often not straightforward. The potential for indexing ambiguity in polar space groups is also an issue, although methods to resolve this are available if the true symmetry is known. Here, a method is presented to simultaneously resolve the determination of the Patterson symmetry and the indexing ambiguity for partial data sets.},
